I am a computer engineer with a focus on embedded systems, operating systems, and networking. I recently completed my B.S. in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, where I concentrated in Networking & Cybersecurity and Software Systems. My experience spans kernel development, embedded hardware/software integration, and distributed applications.

I have worked as a Summer Research Intern at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, where I developed a simulator for EO/IR sensors in C++ and ported signal processing kernels to Rust, and as a Capture the Flag Developer at the Virginia Cyber Range, where I authored over fifty technical challenges in reverse engineering, networking, and cybersecurity. At Virginia Tech, I led a capstone team to design a LoRa-based venting system for high-altitude balloons, developed a wireless gait sensor to support fall-risk prediction, and created multiple Linux kernel modules, including a scheduler profiler and page table walker.

I am passionate about building systems that bring hardware and software together to solve complex problems, and I am eager to continue contributing to projects with real-world impact.
